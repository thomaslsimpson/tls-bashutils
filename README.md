# tls-bashutils
Bash utilities I like to have on hand.

These are mostly just utilities that I find myself wanting if I'm missing them on a new system.
Since I find myself using Docker and Linode and AWS all the time, I'm always logging into yet
another Linux machine. So, this way I can grab utilities that I like to tote with me.
